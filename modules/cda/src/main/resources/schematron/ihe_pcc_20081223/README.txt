Title: IHE PCC Guideline Schematron Package

Description: This package contains the schematron rules for validating XML documents against the guidelines specified by the IHE Patient Care Coordination (PCC) Technical Framework.  Please note that these schematron files check for conformance against IHE PCC rules only.  Running XML documents through these schematron files will not check them against any Clinical Document Architecture Release 2 (CDA R2), Continuity of Care (CCD) or CDA For Common Document Types (CDA4CDT) rules which the PCC specifications may require.  Schematron for CCD and CDA4CDT can be downloaded from the HL7 Wiki (http://wiki.hl7.org/).
